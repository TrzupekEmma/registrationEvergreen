# Instructions
Through Activities 1 and 2, students will become familiar with using sqlite and flask to create more complex flask templates. Students will also learn how to create forms that can pass data to and from flask, eventually integrating with the sqlite database.

# Activity 1
The database is populated with student data in ```myDatabase.db```. Your task is to use flask and build a template that allows you to display ALL of the students' information to the screen.

# Activity 2
Extend Activity 1 by creating a separate flask route that renders a form template. On this form, the user should be prompted to input information about new students that, upon submitting, will get inserted into the database. The newly-inserted data should be immediately viewable when the user accesses the default route set up in Activity 1.
